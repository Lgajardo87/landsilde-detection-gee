# landsilde-detection-gee

This repository contains the Google Earth Engine (GEE) script developed for the study:

**Rainfall-Induced Landslide Detection in the Central–Southern Andes of Chile Using Integrated SAR, Optical, and Machine Learning Approaches in Google Earth Engine**

## Description
The script implements a multi-sensor methodological framework for rainfall-induced landslide detection using:
- Sentinel-1 SAR data (VV and VH polarizations)
- Sentinel-2 optical imagery (NDVI change)
- SRTM-derived topographic variables
- Random Forest supervised classification

## Code
The main script is located in: https://github.com/Lgajardo87/landsilde-detection-gee.git
